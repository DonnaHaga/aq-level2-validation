# Wind Roses

Wind roses for `r params$year` and 5 previous years (when available). 

Things to look for when validating wind data:

+ Annual windrose
+ Windrose from previous years
+ Percent calm winds for the past 5-8 years
+ Do we have any pictures of the station?
+ Does the windrose make sense to you relative to the local topography?
+ RH - does RH get to 100% or does it max out at 97%? Has this changed recently?
+ Can I see any obvious breakpoints in a strip chart where something changes/
